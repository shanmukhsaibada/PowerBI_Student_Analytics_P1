# Student Habits & Mental Health – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how student habits such as social media usage, study hours, and sleep time influence academic performance and mental health. Using an interactive Power BI dashboard, the report highlights key behavioral trends, correlations, and risk factors to support data-driven decisions by educators, counselors, and researchers.

## Objectives
Understand the relationship between social media usage and student grades.  
Assess how sleep patterns and study habits impact mental health and exam performance.  
Identify at-risk student groups using demographic and behavioral filters.  
Provide actionable insights through an interactive and visually engaging dashboard.  

## Data Preparation
Dataset: 95,000+ records of student lifestyle, social media habits, mental health indicators, and academic scores.  
Data Cleaning:  
- Removed duplicates and inconsistent entries.  
- Standardized categories (e.g., sleep hours, social media usage levels).  
- Handled missing or incomplete data.  
Data Transformation:  
- Built calculated columns and DAX measures for performance metrics and health scores.  
- Categorized continuous variables (low/medium/high usage, good/poor sleep quality).  
- Created a clean star schema model for optimized dashboard performance.  

## Key Features
Primary KPIs: Average academic performance, average sleep hours, mental health index, and social media usage levels.  
Secondary KPIs:  
- How heavy social media use correlates with poor grades.  
- Sleep deprivation impact on mental health.  
- Gender- and age-based trends.  
Visualization Highlights:  
- Correlation charts between study hours, sleep, and grades.  
- Stacked bar/column charts for social media usage vs. exam scores.  
- KPI cards summarizing average metrics.  
- Slicers to filter by age group, gender, usage level, and performance category.  
Interactivity:  
- Drill-through views for individual student segments.  
- Navigation buttons for switching between overview and detailed sections.  

## Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop – Data modeling and interactive dashboard development  
Power Query (M) – ETL processes for cleaning and transforming large datasets  
DAX – Custom measures to calculate correlations and health/performance indices  

## Deliverables
